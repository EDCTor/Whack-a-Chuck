#Whack-a-Chuck

##Description

Whack-a-Chuck is a very simple **whack-a-mole** clone.  The goal is to click or tap the **moles** as they pop out of the holes.

##History

In 2002 the game/idea was originally created in Visual Basic as an in office joke, on a slow afternoon between Christmas and New Years.  Two years later, on a slow afternoon between Christmas and New Years, the game was expanded for other employees.
